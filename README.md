<h2>Introduction to Project</h2>

<p>
Volunteering project.<br />
The site has been in use years 2014-2022 where I helped updating the content on regular basis and improving. My second website I published. 
</p>




<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>Given a free hand to style colours, fonts and logo I was really happy to create professional looking site for a small village club.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The site has few content ideas created to help promote the club in a positive fun way. Home page for example has a short (music) video explaining aspects of tennis and way people should play tennis encouraging for try out games. Posters for upcoming and past events are also included. Really enjoyed video editing, as this was first one of my first attempts on video editing using Windows Video Editor.</p>
