<h2>Introduction to Project</h2>

<p>
Volunteering project.<br />
The site has been in use years 2014-2022 where I helped updating the content on regular basis and improving. My second website I published. 
</p>



<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>Given a free hand to style colours, fonts and logo I was really happy to create professional looking site for a small village club.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The site has few content ideas created to help promote the club in a positive fun way. Home page for example has a short (music) video explaining aspects of tennis and way people should play tennis encouraging for try out games. </p>
